                    <p>MicroAire created a short-term campaign promoting the partnerships with non-profit institutions in support of breast cancer awareness. This included offering a pink surgical hand piece that, when purchased, gave a percentage of the proceeds towards a non-profit.</p>

                    Promote the campaign targeting aesthetic surgeons interested in liposuction and create an overall awareness to result in increased sales of the pink hand piece.

                                    Every pink hand piece sold included a thank you insert, along with a personal letter, reminding customers that their purchase made a difference and supported a good cause.

                                    Plastic surgeons tend to purchase their equipment directly for their practice and are more likely to see the contents inside â€” this is not true for most other types of surgeons working in larger facilities, such as hospitals, as they are typically not the ones to receive the packaged product (which is usually done by their supporting staff members).

                                    Plastic surgeons are often the most active types of surgeons on social media and have an increased potential of being more receptive to online advertising. The team formulated a strategy for targeted advertising that promoted the product along with its non-profit partnership. Advertising took place before and during popular aesthetic trade shows as it's when surgeons tend to be most active on their social accounts.

                                        Photographs were taken in an in-house studio with a focus on the drastic, temporary color change of a popular device that is typically blue.

                                        The marketing team reported that plastic surgeons may be more receptive to color changes as these devices are more "personal" to the surgeons (i.e. they may feel it to be <em>their</em> device rather than just <em>a</em> device). Therefore, it was important to emphasize the color within the photographs.

                                        MicroAire also took part in sponsoring a 5K race for breast reconstruction awareness during an aesthetic trade show. Designed items along with a promotional code discount for purchase of the device were offered to surgeons that signed up for the team as part of an incentive to join in support of the campaign.
